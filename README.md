# Moodle_Extension
This is a chrome extension for IITD peeps which logins to moodle everytime we open the site.

# How to use
Since I am not publishing this extension to web store (because then I would have to ensure more privacy somehow...meh), this procedure might seem a little tedious at first sight but trust me, this won't take more than 5 minutes.

# Step 1: Cloning
Download the zip.
