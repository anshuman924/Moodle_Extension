# Moodle_Extension
This is a chrome extension for IITD peeps which logins to moodle everytime we open the site.

## How to use
Since I am not publishing this extension to web store (because then I would have to ensure more privacy somehow...meh), this procedure might seem a little tedious at first sight but trust me, this won't take more than 5 minutes.

Step 1: Cloning : Download the zip.
Step 2: Unzipping : Unzip the folder such that structure of the folder name moodle_ext contains exactly 2 files namely "manifest.json" and "content.js".
Step 3: Entering Credentials : Open the file "content.js" in any of your text editor. In the first 2 lines, enter your id and password. Save the file and close the file.
Step 4: Entering Developer Mode : Open Google Chrome (Sorry Safari users). In the search box, type in chrome://extensions. Activate developer mode by toggling its button.
Step 5: Loading : Click on "Load Unpacked", which lets you upload one folder. Browse through your directories and upload the downloaded folder.
Step 6: Enjoy : Make sure the extension is enabled. You can turn off the developer mode now. Goto moodle, test it out, make sure to give a feedback.
